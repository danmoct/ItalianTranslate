Boil the rice in abundant salted water, drain it al dente and
let it cool down.

Meanwhile prepare the béchamel by melting in a pan
the butter and then add the flour and milk, which should be
warm. Stir constantly until boiling and season with
salt, pepper and nutmeg when it is almost ready. Let it cool down.

Whisk the egg whites, beat the egg yolks and add them to the rice with the
grated Parmesan cheese. Then transfer the compound into one
buttered mold and bake at 180 ° C for
forty minutes.
