PESTO SAUCE


SAUCES

1 nice tuft of basil, better if in bloom (about 40) leaves), 1 tbsp
of pecorino (Roman, Tuscan, Sardinian or Sicilian), 1 tablespoon of Parmigiano Reggiano
grated, 1 handful of pine nuts, 2 cloves of garlic, oil

If possible, prepare the pesto in the classic marble mortar with the wooden pestle. However (even if the Ligurians are horrified!) You can prepare it properly
also using the blender. Wash and gently dry the
basil leaves. Then put them in the mortar, add the pine nuts, just toasted
in the oven, garlic without peel and a pinch of coarse salt (which will be used for
keep the basil a beautiful green color). Start crushing the ingredients
 pressing them against the walls of the mortar, and add a little at a time
the two types of grated cheese. If you use Sardinian pecorino, be careful
 that is not too spicy! When you got a homogeneous mixture, pour into a bowl and, with a ladle, joined a little at a time about 1/2 glass of oil. Stir gently to obtain a kind
of cream that you will dilute with a little cooking water, in case you use it for seasoning
the pasta, or with broth, in case you use it for a soup or a boiled meat.
Pesto, also known as Genovese pesto, is the jealous secret of many Ligurian housewives
 who still prepare this delicacy at home in a mortar
The recipe given is the traditional one. However, each dose may vary
and the qualities of the cheeses, but always keeping in mind a fundamental rule:
 the pesto succeeds when you have the flair for knowing how to do it, and if you succeed, you succeed well immediately, because it is not a seasoning that can be "fixed": either it is immediately delicious, or you throw it away!
